# AMPEL360 Q100

## Ontology Genesis and Knowledge Model

**Foundational Document**

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the **Ontology Genesis** and **Knowledge Model** underpinning the **AMPEL360 Q100** program.
Its purpose is to explain **how uncertainty becomes justified, planned, resolved, validated, and operationalized** through a disciplined, AI-orchestrated knowledge architecture.

The model applies to:

* system definition and evolution,
* lifecycle planning and prediction,
* certification-ready documentation,
* operational and maintenance knowledge delivery.

---

## 2. Core Architectural Principle

The AMPEL360 Q100 program is built on a **dual-architecture knowledge system**:

* **SSOT (Single Source of Truth)**
  The authoritative digital backbone integrating **Knowledge Lifecycle Management (KLM)** and **Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)**.

* **CSDB (Common Source DataBase)**
  The operational reference layer delivering modular, reusable, and controlled content (e.g. S1000D/IETP).

This duality ensures a strict separation between:

* **what is true and controlled**, and
* **what is used and consumed**.

## 3. Ontology Genesis Overview

Ontology Genesis describes the **structured progression from uncertainty to operational knowledge**.

It is not a linear pipeline, but a **governed, forked knowledge flow**.

### Canonical Ontology Flow

```
O-KNOT
  → Y-KNOT
    → KNOT
        → SSOT
      → KNU
          → CSDB
          → NU (Units)
```

## 4. Ontology Elements

### 4.1 O-KNOT — Origin Knowledge Node

**Problem-statement awareness**

O-KNOTs capture **inherited or emergent unknown spaces**, identified through:

* historical heritage data transfer,
* prior programs and assumptions,
* predictive analysis and early insights,
* novel architectures or contextual changes.

O-KNOTs establish that a **meaningful unknown exists**, without yet defining relevance, scope, or resolution.

**Key question:**
*What do we not yet understand?*

**Role:**
Trigger for program or lifecycle genesis.

---

### 4.2 Y-KNOT — Why-Knowledge Node

**Justification and decision logic**

Y-KNOTs justify the existence of an O-KNOT and decompose it into a **decision tree**:

* relevance and impact (safety, certification, cost, schedule, operations),
* bounded or binary options,
* assumptions, constraints, and rationale.

Y-KNOTs generate **decision logic**, not execution plans.

**Key question:**
*Why does this matter, and what choices exist?*

---

### 4.3 KNOT — Knowledge Node Ontology Trading

**Framed uncertainty and planning**

KNOTs formalize uncertainty into a **governed, bounded knowledge space** and generate:

* resolution strategies,
* task decomposition,
* sequencing and acceptance criteria.

At this point:

* justification is closed,
* execution intent is defined.

**Key question:**
*What must be done to resolve this uncertainty?*

---

## 5. Forked Knowledge Resolution Paths

### 5.1 KNOT → SSOT

**Authoritative digital knowledge platform**

One branch consolidates outcomes into the **SSOT**, integrating:

* validated definitions and decisions,
* evidence and traceability,
* lifecycle prediction and planning,
* KLM + PLM coherence.

SSOT represents **engineering and program truth**:

* authoritative,
* governed,
* auditable,
* certification-ready.

**Key question:**
*What is now considered true and controlled?*

---

### 5.2 KNOT → KNU

**Executable resolution units**

The second branch generates **KNUs (Knowledge Node Units)**:

* tests,
* analyses,
* specifications,
* procedures,
* automation pipelines.

KNUs often begin as **TBDs** (unknown units to be resolved) and are progressively closed through execution.

**Key question:**
*How is the uncertainty resolved in practice?*

---

## 6. Operationalization

### 6.1 KNU → CSDB

**Operational knowledge delivery**

KNU outputs are transformed into **CSDB reference datasets**, enabling:

* S1000D-compliant data modules,
* IETP and maintenance publications,
* pre-delivered and predictive publications (PreDeV / PrePub),
* UI/UX-adapted and export-controlled deliverables.

CSDB represents **operational truth**, optimized for reuse and frontline consumption.

---

### 6.2 KNU → NU (Units)

**Atomic execution and consumption**

KNUs also produce **NUs (Units)**, the smallest reusable elements:

* checklist rows,
* procedure steps,
* parameter sets,
* executable task units.

NUs are:

* atomic,
* composable,
* traceable back to KNOTs and SSOT,
* directly consumable by humans, systems, or automation.

---

## 7. Role of GenAI and Prompt Engineering

GenAI is integrated as a **governed capability**, not an ad-hoc generator.

It supports:

* discovery and prediction at the O-KNOT level,
* decision exploration at the Y-KNOT level,
* planning assistance at the KNOT level,
* execution acceleration at the KNU level,
* consistency and coherence across SSOT and CSDB.

Prompt engineering is treated as a **production discipline**, ensuring reliable, contextualized, and traceable knowledge creation.

---

## 8. Foundational Principles (Locked)

* Uncertainty precedes justification.
* Justification precedes planning.
* Planning precedes execution.
* Authority (SSOT) is separate from use (CSDB).
* Execution (KNU) is separate from truth definition (SSOT).
* Atomic units (NU) are what is actually consumed.

> **SSOT defines what is true.
> KNU executes what must be done.
> CSDB delivers what is used.
> NU is what is consumed.**

## 9. One-Paragraph Summary

**AMPEL360 Q100 Ontology Genesis** evolves from **O-KNOT uncertainty**, through **Y-KNOT justification** and **KNOT planning**, into an **authoritative digital platform integrating SSOT (KLM + PLM)** and **lifecycle prediction planning via KNUs/TBDs**, generating **custom, certification-ready solutions**—including IETP, UI/UX, and export-controlled deliverables—based on **CSDB reference datasets** and **atomic knowledge units (NU)**.
