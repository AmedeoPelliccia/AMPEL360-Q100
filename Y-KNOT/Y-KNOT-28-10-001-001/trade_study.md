## Y-KNOT-28-10-001-001: Fuel Storage Resolution

### Overview

This trade study evaluates resolution approaches for the ATA 28-10 Fuel Storage knowledge gaps related to novel hydrogen cryogenic storage systems.

### Study Objectives

1. Evaluate certification pathway options
2. Assess technology maturity considerations
3. Identify optimal resolution approach

### Option Analysis

#### Option A: Conventional Certification Path

**Description:** Apply existing certification methods adapted for hydrogen systems.

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Safety Compliance | 3 | 0.30 | 0.90 |
| Schedule Risk | 4 | 0.25 | 1.00 |
| Cost Efficiency | 4 | 0.20 | 0.80 |
| Technical Maturity | 2 | 0.25 | 0.50 |
| **Total** | | | **3.20** |

#### Option B: Novel Means of Compliance

**Description:** Develop new certification approaches specific to hydrogen cryogenic systems.

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Safety Compliance | 5 | 0.30 | 1.50 |
| Schedule Risk | 2 | 0.25 | 0.50 |
| Cost Efficiency | 2 | 0.20 | 0.40 |
| Technical Maturity | 4 | 0.25 | 1.00 |
| **Total** | | | **3.40** |

#### Option C: Hybrid Certification Approach

**Description:** Combine conventional methods where applicable with novel approaches for unique aspects.

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Safety Compliance | 5 | 0.30 | 1.50 |
| Schedule Risk | 3 | 0.25 | 0.75 |
| Cost Efficiency | 3 | 0.20 | 0.60 |
| Technical Maturity | 4 | 0.25 | 1.00 |
| **Total** | | | **3.85** |

### Recommendation

**Option C: Hybrid Certification Approach** is recommended based on:
- Highest weighted score (3.85)
- Optimal balance of safety and schedule
