## OPT-IN Framework Overview

The OPT-IN framework organizes all Q100 documentation along five orthogonal axes:



| Axis | Stands For | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O | Organizations | Organizational structure and stakeholder areas |
| I | Interfaces | System interfaces and integration points |
| N | Nodes | Physical locations and installation points |
| T | Technologies | Technical systems grouped by ATA chapters |
| P | Processes | Business processes and workflows |


Example Path:

OPT-IN_FRAMEWORK/
  T-TECHNOLOGIES_AMEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/
    E1-PROPULSION/
      ATA_71-POWER_PLANT/
        ATA-71-power-plant/
          71-00-general/
            SSOT/
              LC02_SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS/
                KNU-71-00-001-REQ-001_fuel-cell-requirements.md
            PUB/
              AMM/
                CSDB/
                  DM/
                    DMC-AMPEL360-71-00-00-00A-001A-A_001-00_EN-US.XML

This path demonstrates:

T-axis: Technologies (specifically E1-Propulsion)
                        ATA 71: Power Plant chapter
                        SSOT: Single Source of Truth (engineering artifacts)
                        PUB: Publications (derived documentation)
                        LC02: Lifecycle category (System Requirements)


## ATA Chapter Structure

The Q100 program uses ATA iSpec 2200 chapter numbering (00-99) to organize 
                    technical systems:



| ATA Chapter | System | Q100 Relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | General | Program-wide standards, terminology, training |
| 05 | Periodic Inspections | Maintenance planning |
| 06 | Dimensions and Areas | BWB configuration management |
| 21 | Air Conditioning | HVAC including cryogenic heat loads |
| 24 | Electrical Power | ±270 VDC+ fuel cell power distribution |
| 28 | Fuel | LH₂/GH₂ storage, distribution, boil-off management |
| 33 | Lights | Exterior/interior lighting systems |
| 71 | Power Plant | Fuel cell stacks, electric motors |
| 95 | AI/ML Models | Q100-specific: Learning assurance, runtime monitoring |
| 96 | Digital Product Passport | Q100-specific: DPP integration, traceability |


NOTE: ATA 95 and 96 are Q100 program extensions beyond standard ATA iSpec 2200.


## Lifecycle Categories (LC01-LC13)

Within SSOT directories, artifacts are organized by lifecycle category:



| Code | Category | Typical Contents |

## KNOT/KNU Methodology

The Q100 program uses KNOT (Knowledge Nexus of Tangible-uncertainties) and 
                    KNU (Knowledge Nugget Units) to manage knowledge creation and uncertainty reduction.


### What is a KNOT?

A KNOT is a cluster of related uncertainties requiring coordinated resolution. 
                        Each KNOT has:

Unique ID (e.g., KNOT-00-00-001)
                            Residual uncertainty score (0-100, target ≤15)
                            Set of KNUs for resolution
                            TT token pool for incentivization
                            Stakeholder ownership (STK_* roles)

Example KNOT: KNOT-00-00-001 
                        (Controlled Terminology Foundation) includes 12 KNUs covering glossary 
                        requirements, database schema, term type taxonomy, validation tests, and 
                        usage guides.


### What is a KNU?

A KNU is an atomic unit of knowledge creation work that produces a specific, 
                        verifiable artifact. Each KNU has:

Unique ID following pattern: KNU-{ATA}-{SUBSYS}-{SEQ}-{TYPE}-{NUM}
                            Type: REQ, SAF, ICD, ANA, TEST, PUB, CM, PLAN
                            Status: ⚪PLANNED → 🔵GENERATED → 🟢APPROVED or 🔴BLOCKED
                            Owner (Area of Responsibility)
                            Effort estimate (story points)
                            TT token allocation upon completion

Example KNU: KNU-00-00-001-REQ-001 
                        (Program Glossary Requirements) defines requirements for Q100 terminology 
                        management. Type=REQ, Status=GENERATED, Owner=STK_CM, Effort=8.


### KNU Lifecycle

PLANNED: KNU identified 
                                in KNU_PLAN.csv, not yet started.
                            
                            
                                GENERATED: Artifact 
                                created and committed to repository, awaiting review.
                            
                            
                                APPROVED: Artifact 
                                reviewed, approved, and baselined. TT tokens allocated.
                            
                            
                                BLOCKED: KNU cannot 
                                proceed due to unresolved TBD or missing dependency.


## Document Numbering Conventions

All Q100 documents follow strict naming conventions:


### KNU Identifier Format

KNU-{ATA}-{SUBSYS}-{SEQ}-{TYPE}-{NUM}

Where:
  ATA     = 2-digit ATA chapter (00-99)
  SUBSYS  = 2-digit subsystem (00-99)
  SEQ     = 3-digit sequence (001-999)
  TYPE    = Artifact type (REQ, ICD, ANA, etc.)
  NUM     = 3-digit artifact number (001-999)

Examples:
  KNU-00-00-001-REQ-001  = General, subsys 00, seq 001, Requirements #001
  KNU-71-00-003-ICD-002  = Power Plant, general, seq 003, ICD #002
  KNU-28-10-001-TEST-001 = Fuel, LH₂ storage, seq 001, Test #001


### S1000D DMC Format

S1000D Data Module Codes (DMCs) follow S1000D standard:

DMC-{MODEL}-{SYSDIFF}-{SYS}-{SUBSYS}-{SUBSUBSYS}{ASSY}-{DISASSY}{VAR}-{INFO}{VAR}-{LOC}_{LEARN}-{EVENT}_{LANG}.{EXT}

Example:
DMC-AMPEL360-00-00-00-00A-042A-A_001-00_EN-US.XML

Where:
  AMPEL360 = Model identifier
  00-00-00-00A = System breakdown
  042A-A = Info code + variant (042 = Usage Guide)
  001-00 = Learn code + event
  EN-US = Language (English-US)
  XML = File format


## SSOT vs PUB Distinction

Understanding the difference between SSOT and PUB is critical:



| Aspect | SSOT (Single Source of Truth) | PUB (Publications) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Engineering artifacts, authoritative source | Derived documentation for end users |
| Format | Markdown, YAML, CSV, JSON | S1000D XML, PDF, HTML (IETM) |
| Lifecycle | LC01-LC13 categories | AMM, CMM, IPC, TRN, etc. |
| Edit Control | Direct editing by engineers | Generated from SSOT, manual edits discouraged |
| Example | KNU-28-00-001-REQ-001_fuel-system-requirements.md | DMC-AMPEL360-28-00-00-00A-001A-A_001-00_EN-US.XML |


Key Rule: SSOT is the authoritative 
                    source. PUB documents are derived via transformation tools or CIR export. 
                    Never manually edit both SSOT and PUB for the same content.


## Repository Navigation Guide

To find a specific document in the repository:

Identify the OPT-IN axis (O, I, N, T, or P)
                        
                        
                            Navigate to ATA chapter directory
                        
                        
                            Choose SSOT or PUB path
                        
                        
                            For SSOT: Select lifecycle category (LC01-LC13)
                        
                        
                            For PUB: Select publication type (AMM, CMM, TRN, etc.)
                        
                        
                            Locate file by KNU ID or DMC

Example Search: Find the fuel cell 
                    requirements document.
