## Term Type Taxonomy

The AMPEL360 Q100 terminology database supports 12 distinct term types, 
                    each with specific characteristics and usage patterns. The following sections 
                    provide detailed guidance for each type.


### 1. NOUN

Definition: A word or phrase 
                        that represents a person, place, thing, or concept. Nouns are the most 
                        common term type in technical documentation.

When to Use:

Physical components or assemblies (e.g., "Fuel Cell", "Cryogenic Tank")
                            Systems or subsystems (e.g., "Propulsion System", "Avionics Suite")
                            Materials or substances (e.g., "Liquid Hydrogen", "Composite Material")
                            Proper names (e.g., "Q100", "AMPEL360")

Q100 Examples:



| Term | Context |
| --- | --- |
| Fuel Cell Stack | ATA 71 - Power Plant |
| Blended Wing Body | ATA 05 - Airframe |
| Learning Assurance | ATA 95 - AI/ML Systems |
| Boil-Off Gas | ATA 28 - Fuel System |


Common Mistakes:

❌ Classifying verb forms as nouns (e.g., "refueling" should be VERB, not NOUN)
                            ❌ Confusing nouns with concepts (use CONCEPT for abstract ideas)


### 2. VERB

Definition: A word that describes 
                        an action, occurrence, or state of being. Verbs are used to document 
                        procedures, processes, and operations.

When to Use:

Maintenance actions (e.g., "inspect", "replace", "calibrate")
                            System operations (e.g., "pressurize", "depressurize", "vent")
                            Data processing (e.g., "analyze", "compute", "validate")

Q100 Examples:



| Term | Context |
| --- | --- |
| cryocool | LH₂ tank thermal management |
| reliquify | Boil-off gas recovery |
| inference | AI/ML model execution |



### 3. ADJECTIVE

Definition: A word that modifies 
                        or describes a noun, providing additional information about its properties 
                        or characteristics.

Q100 Examples:

"cryogenic" (describing ultra-low temperature conditions)
                            "hybrid" (describing dual-mode propulsion)
                            "supervised" (describing ML training methodology)


### 4. ADVERB

Definition: A word that modifies 
                        a verb, adjective, or another adverb, typically indicating manner, time, 
                        place, or degree.

Q100 Examples:

"autonomously" (system operation mode)
                            "continuously" (monitoring frequency)


### 5. PHRASE

Definition: A multi-word expression 
                        that functions as a single semantic unit but is not an acronym or abbreviation.

When to Use:

Technical terms that cannot be reduced to single words
                            Domain-specific expressions with established meaning

Q100 Examples:



| Term | Context |
| --- | --- |
| zero boil-off | Cryogenic storage management |

                        from the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word (not letter-by-letter).

Key Distinction: Pronounced as a 
                        word (e.g., "NASA", "RADAR") vs. letter-by-letter (e.g., "XML", "API" — these are ABBREVIATION).

Q100 Examples:



| Acronym | Full Form | Pronunciation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KNOT | Knowledge Nexus of Tangible-uncertainties | "not" (as a word) |
| KNU | Knowledge Nugget Unit | "new" (as a word) |
| SSOT | Single Source of Truth | "sot" (as a word) |



### 7. ABBREVIATION

Definition: A shortened form of 
                        a word or phrase, pronounced letter-by-letter or as a contraction.

Q100 Examples:



| Abbreviation | Full Form | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LH₂ | Liquid Hydrogen | Chemical notation |
| GH₂ | Gaseous Hydrogen | Chemical notation |
| TBD | To Be Determined | Letter-by-letter |
| OOD | Out-of-Distribution | Letter-by-letter |



### 8. SYMBOL

Definition: A graphical or 
                        character representation used to denote a specific concept or operation.

| ≤ | Less than or equal to |
| ∆ | Delta / change |



### 9. FORMULA

Definition: A mathematical or 
                        chemical expression representing a relationship or composition.

Q100 Examples:

2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O + Energy (fuel cell reaction)
                            E = m × c² (energy-mass equivalence)
                            w_i = α × Ê_i + (1 - α) × Î_i (TT allocation formula)


### 10. UNIT

Definition: A standard quantity 
                        used to express physical measurements.

                            → NO: Continue to step 2
                        
                        
                            Is it a graphical symbol or special character?
                            → YES: Use SYMBOL
                            → NO: Continue to step 3
                        
                        
                            Is it a shortened form?
                            → YES, pronounced as a word: Use ACRONYM
                            → YES, pronounced letter-by-letter or contraction: Use ABBREVIATION
                            → NO: Continue to step 4
                        
                        
                            Does it measure something?
                            → YES, it's a standard of measurement: Use UNIT
                            → YES, it's what's being measured: Use QUANTITY
                            → NO: Continue to step 5
                        
                        
                            What part of speech is it?

## Usage Notes

Mandatory Compliance: All CSDB authors 
                    must follow this guidance when adding terms to the terminology database. 
                    Incorrect term type classification may result in publication errors and 
                    inconsistencies.

Updates: This guide is maintained by 
                    STK_CM and updated as the term type taxonomy evolves. Check for the latest 
                    version before submitting new terms.
