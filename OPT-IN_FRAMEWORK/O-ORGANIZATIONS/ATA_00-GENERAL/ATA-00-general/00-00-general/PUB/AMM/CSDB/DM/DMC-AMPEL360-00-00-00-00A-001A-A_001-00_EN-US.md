### KNOT (Knowledge Nexus of Tangible-uncertainties)

### KNOT

**Definition:** A cluster of related uncertainties requiring resolution through coordinated knowledge creation activities (KNUs). KNOTs serve as the primary organizational unit for managing residual uncertainty in the program.

**Full Form:** Knowledge Nexus of Tangible-uncertainties

**Type:** ACRONYM

**Context:** Program management, risk management, systems engineering

**KNOT Attributes:**

- Residual uncertainty score (0-100)
- Target residual (typically ≤15)
- Planned KNUs for resolution
- TT token pool for incentivization
- Stakeholder ownership (STK_* roles)

**Closure Criteria:** KNOT closes when all KNUs complete, residual ≤ target, artifacts validated, and TT rewards distributed.

**Related Terms:** [KNU](#term-knu), [TBD](#term-tbd), [TT](#term-tt)

### KNU (Knowledge Nugget Unit)

### KNU

**Definition:** An atomic unit of knowledge creation work that reduces uncertainty by producing a specific, verifiable artifact (requirement, analysis, test, etc.). KNUs are the fundamental work units tracked within KNOTs.

**Full Form:** Knowledge Nugget Unit

**Type:** ACRONYM

**Context:** Work breakdown structure, earned value management

**KNU Types:**

| Type | Artifact Produced |
|---|---|

| PUB | Publication (AMM, CMM, etc.) |

**KNU Lifecycle:** PLANNED → GENERATED → APPROVED (or BLOCKED if dependencies not met)

### TBD (To Be Determined)

### TBD

**Definition:** An identified uncertainty or open item discovered during artifact creation that requires resolution through additional work.  TBDs automatically spawn new KNUs for resolution, creating a dynamic feedback loop in the knowledge creation process.  

**Full Form:** To Be Determined

**Type:** ABBREVIATION

**Context:** Requirements management, risk management

**TBD Impact Classes:**

| Class | Description | Approval |
|---|---|---|
| CLASS I | Major — Multiple KNUs, cross-KNOT impacts | STK_CM + STK_SE + KNOT owners |
| CLASS II | Minor — Single KNU, localized impact | AoR owner |
| CLASS III | Repair — Inline fix, no KNU spawn | Author |

**TBD-to-KNU Spawning:** Each TBD automatically triggers creation of primary resolution KNU plus any triggered cascade modifications, forming a Modification Package tracked for TT distribution.

**Example:** "[TBD-28-10-005-ICD-001-001] Final LH₂ boil-off rate determination pending thermal analysis"

### TT (Trust Token)

### TT

**Definition:** A non-transferable incentive token awarded for successful knowledge creation (KNU completion) based on effort and impact on uncertainty reduction. TT serves as earned value metric and recognition mechanism.

**Full Form:** Trust Token

**Type:** ABBREVIATION

**Context:** Tokenomics, incentive system, earned value management

**Unit Conversion:** 1 TT = 360 degrees (deg)

**Allocation Formula:**

```
w_i = α × Ê_i + (1 - α) × Î_i
```
*Where:*

**w_i = Weight for KNU i**

**Ê_i = Normalized effort (story points)** 

**Î_i = Normalized impact (residual reduction + spillover)**

**α = Effort weight (typically 0.30)**

**1-α = Impact weight (typically 0.70)**

**Bonuses:**

- TBD Resolution Bonus:   +10% for resolving blocking TBDs
- Cascade Management Bonus: +10% for managing modification packages
- Cross-KNOT Coordination:   +5% for cross-KNOT integration

**Distribution:** TT distributed at KNOT closure after all KNUs approved and baselined.
