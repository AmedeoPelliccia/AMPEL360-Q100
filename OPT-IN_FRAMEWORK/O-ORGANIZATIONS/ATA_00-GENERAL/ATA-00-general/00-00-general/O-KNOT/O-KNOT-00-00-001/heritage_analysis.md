# Heritage Analysis

## O-KNOT-00-00-001: General Program Knowledge Gap

### Overview

This document captures the historical and legacy source analysis for the identified knowledge gap.

### Heritage Sources

1. **Prior Program Documentation**
   - Existing documentation from predecessor programs
   - Known gaps in documentation coverage
   - Areas requiring updated analysis

2. **Legacy System Assumptions**
   - Assumptions carried forward from legacy systems
   - Validity assessment required
   - Impact on current program scope

3. **Historical Data Transfer**
   - Data migration requirements
   - Format and structure considerations
   - Preservation of traceability

### Initial Assessment

The heritage analysis indicates that systematic documentation review is required to:
- Identify specific knowledge gaps
- Assess impact on current program
- Define resolution priorities

### Next Steps

This O-KNOT will transition to Y-KNOT justification once the discovery phase is complete.
