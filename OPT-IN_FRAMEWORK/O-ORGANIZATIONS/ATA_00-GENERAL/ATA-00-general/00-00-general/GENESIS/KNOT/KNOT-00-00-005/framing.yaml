# Bounded Scope
scope_in:
  - Primary/secondary unit convention for all Q100 documentation
  - Conversion tables for SI ↔ imperial units
  - Display precision standards for measurements
  - H₂-specific units (energy density, flow rates, cryogenic temps)
  - Traceability to international standards (ISO 80000)

scope_out:
  - Unit implementation in analysis tools (separate engineering effort)
  - Specific engineering calculations (use established conversion factors)
  - Real-time unit conversion in software systems

# Acceptance Criteria (Intent Level)
acceptance_intent:
  - All Q100 documents use consistent primary/secondary unit notation
  - Conversion factors verified against international standards
  - H₂-specific units clearly defined and consistently applied
  - Display precision rules established for all measurement types
  - Regulatory compliance (FAA/EASA) verified

# High-Level Dependencies
dependencies:
  upstream:
    - KNOT-00-00-001: Program terminology standardization
  downstream:
    - All ATA chapters using measurements and units
    - LC02 system requirements for unit specifications
    - LC04 design definitions using unit systems

# Notes
notes: |
  This KNOT addresses the specific challenge of H₂-specific units
  (e.g., kg/m³ for liquid hydrogen density, kJ/kg for specific energy)
  which are not commonly used in conventional aircraft documentation.
  
  The residual target is set to 5 (very low uncertainty) because unit
  conversions are well-established and can be directly referenced from
  international standards.
