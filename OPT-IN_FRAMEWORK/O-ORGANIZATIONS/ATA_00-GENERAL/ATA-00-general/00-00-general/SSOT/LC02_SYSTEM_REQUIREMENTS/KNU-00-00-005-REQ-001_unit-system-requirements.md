# Unit System Requirements

**KNU ID:** KNU-00-00-005-REQ-001  
**KNOT:** KNOT-00-00-005 (Unit System Convention)  
**ATA Reference:** 00-00 (General)  
**ATA Address:** ATA-00-00-00-00  
**Status:** ✅ REVIEWED  
**Version:** I01-R03  
**Owner:** STK_SE  
**REC:** LC02_SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **program-wide unit system requirements** for AMPEL360 Q100 artifacts (SSOT engineering evidence and PUB deliverables). The unit scheme shall enable:

- consistent engineering calculations and data storage,
- unambiguous interpretation across disciplines,
- predictable conversion and rounding at interfaces,
- certification-ready traceability of numeric evidence.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In-Scope
- Primary vs secondary unit conventions by domain/use-case
- Canonical (“storage”) units for machine data and calculations
- Display/reporting unit rules (PUB and operator-facing outputs)
- Conversion factors, rounding, significant figures
- Unit tagging requirements for data interchange (e.g., JSON, CSV, YAML, ICDs)
- Exceptions process for legacy/authority conventions

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope
- Tool implementation details (handled by ICD/CM artifacts)
- ARINC/AFDX label-level encoding requirements
- S1000D DMC coding and BREX authoring (addressed in PUB governance)
- Unit conversion library selection

---

## 3. Applicable Documents

| Document | Title / Applicability |
|----------|------------------------|
| ISO 80000 (series) | Quantities and units (SI quantity naming conventions) |
| SI Brochure | International System of Units (SI) definitions |
| ISO 8601 | Date/time formatting (used alongside unit tagging) |
| ATA iSpec 2200 | Publication conventions (unit presentation consistency) |
| CS-25.1301 / CS-25.1309 | System integrity; numeric evidence must be consistent and verifiable |
| KNU-00-00-002-REQ-001 | Document numbering and file naming conventions |
| KNU-00-00-004-REQ-001 | Cross-reference and traceability system requirements |

> **Note:** This KNU defines unit conventions; discipline-specific requirements (e.g., flight test reporting units) may impose secondary display conventions but shall not change canonical storage rules.

---

## 4. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Canonical Unit | The authoritative unit used for storage and calculations (SSOT truth) |
| Display Unit | The unit used for human-facing presentation (reports, manuals, UI) |
| Primary Unit | Default unit for a domain (often canonical) |
| Secondary Unit | Allowed alternative unit, typically for operational/regulatory familiarity |
| Mixed Units | Two or more unit systems used within a single value expression (generally prohibited) |

---

## 5. Unit System Policy

### 5.1 Canonical Policy (Program Default)
- **Canonical unit system shall be SI** for all SSOT calculations and stored numerical values unless an exception is explicitly justified and recorded.

### 5.2 Domain Conventions (Primary/Secondary)
The following table defines domain defaults. “Primary” indicates the default unit set for authoring and review. “Canonical” indicates storage/calculation.

| Domain / Use | Primary | Canonical | Allowed Secondary (display only unless stated) |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Mass properties (ATA 08) | kg, m, N | SI | lb (display), in (display) |
| Structures / loads | N, kN, Pa | SI | lbf (display), psi (display), in (display) |
| Aerodynamics / performance | SI + aviation practice | SI | kt, ft, NM (display) |
| Flight operations / procedures | aviation practice | SI (stored) | kt, ft, NM (primary display) |
| Electrical (HVDC, power) | V, A, W, kW | SI | hp (display) |
| Energy (battery/H₂) | J, kJ, MJ, kWh, kg | SI | BTU (display) |
| Cryogenic LH₂ | K (state), kg, Pa | SI | °C (ambient display), bar (display), kPa (display) |
| Pressure systems (pneumatic/GH₂) | Pa/kPa/MPa | SI | bar (display), psi (display) |
| Publications (AMM, etc.) | operator convention | SI (source) | dual-unit presentation as required |

### 5.3 SSOT Architecture vs. Traditional CSDB

The Domain Conventions table in Section 5.2 reveals a **critical architectural insight** that validates the AMPEL360 approach to establishing a **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** distinct from the traditional **Common Source Database (CSDB)**.

#### 5.3.1 Multi-Domain Unit Complexity

Traditional CSDB systems assume:
- Single canonical unit system (typically SI)
- Simple conversion at presentation layer
- No domain-specific authoring contexts

The AMPEL360 reality is more complex:
- ATA-08 authors work in kg/m
- Flight operations authors work in kt/ft/NM
- Publications need dual-unit presentation
- Cryogenic systems mix K (state) + °C (ambient)

#### 5.3.2 Primary vs. Canonical Separation

The **key innovation** of the AMPEL360 SSOT architecture is the separation of Primary, Canonical, and Secondary units:

| Concept | Definition | CSDB Approach | AMPEL360 SSOT Approach |
|---------|------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Primary** | Authoring/review unit set | ❌ Ignored | ✅ **Domain-specific** (e.g., aviation practice for flight ops) |
| **Canonical** | Storage/calculation unit | ✅ SI enforced | ✅ **SI for computation** |
| **Secondary** | Display-only alternatives | ⚠️ Ad-hoc conversion | ✅ **Controlled presentation layer** |

#### 5.3.3 Aviation Practice Domain

The "Flight operations / procedures" row demonstrates a pattern that breaks CSDB assumptions:
- Authors work in **kt/ft/NM** (primary)
- System stores in **SI** (canonical)
- Operators see **kt/ft/NM** (primary display, not secondary!)

This pattern requires metadata to track unit provenance through the data lifecycle.

#### 5.3.4 SSOT Metadata Schema

The SSOT stores **canonical SI values** with **metadata tags** indicating:
- `primary_unit`: The authoring/domain unit
- `display_unit`: Context-specific presentation unit
- `domain`: ATA chapter or operational context

**Example JSON:**
```json
{
  "parameter": "cruise_speed",
  "canonical_value": 77.17,
  "canonical_unit": "m/s",
  "primary_unit": "kt",
  "primary_value": 150,
  "domain": "auto_flight",
  "ata_chapter": "22"
}
```

#### 5.3.5 Rationale for SSOT Architecture Beyond CSDB

Traditional S1000D CSDB assumes:
- Single authoring unit system (SI)
- Simple display-time conversion
- No preservation of domain context

AMPEL360 requires:
- **Multi-domain authoring** (aviation practice vs. engineering SI)
- **Bidirectional traceability** (display unit ↔ canonical unit)
- **Regulatory compliance** (FAA/EASA accept kt/ft, not m/s)

**Conclusion:** CSDB is a component within the SSOT, not a replacement. The SSOT provides the domain-aware metadata layer that CSDB cannot natively support.
