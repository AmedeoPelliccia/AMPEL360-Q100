# Programme Aggregator

**Location:** `00-01-programme/GENESIS/01_PROGRAM_AGGREGATOR/`  
**Purpose:** Single authoritative programme spine  
**Nature:** The **root of reality** for AMPEL360 Q100

---

## 1. What is the Programme Aggregator?

The **Programme Aggregator** is the **single authoritative source** for:

1. **Programme identity** — What AMPEL360 Q100 is
2. **Repository structure** — How work is organized
3. **Information architecture** — How knowledge flows
4. **Governance model** — Who decides what
5. **Registry semantics** — Where truth is recorded

This is the **programmatic root**. Everything else derives from it.

## 3. Programme Identity

### 3.1 Programme Name

**AMPEL360 Q100** (AMPEL360-AIR-T)

### 3.2 Programme Mission

Demonstrate climate-neutral aviation through:
- Hydrogen-electric propulsion (H₂ PEM fuel cells)
- Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration
- Digital engineering baseline (GENESIS/SSOT/TEKNIA)
- EU NetZero contribution through verifiable knowledge production

### 3.3 Programme Scope

| Dimension | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| **Aircraft Type** | ~100 passenger regional aircraft |
| **Propulsion** | H₂ PEM fuel cells + distributed electric |
| **Configuration** | Blended Wing Body (BWB) |
| **Phase** | Concept → demonstration (TRL 3-6) |
| **Geography** | EU-aligned (Clean Aviation, Horizon Europe) |
| **Timeline** | 2024-2035 (development), 2035+ (entry into service target) |

## 4. Authority Declaration

This Programme Aggregator establishes **explicit authority** for:

1. **Repository structure** — OPT-IN Framework (5 axes × 79 ATA chapters)
2. **Information architecture** — GENESIS/SSOT separation, TEKNIA/KBL methodology
3. **Governance** — Decision rights, change control, stakeholder roles
4. **Traceability** — Registry systems, Knowledge Blockchain Ledger

No work product can claim programme authority without tracing back to this aggregator.

## 5. Why This Matters

### Before Programme Aggregator

*"We have documentation and code, but where does programme authority come from?"*

### After Programme Aggregator

*"Programme authority is explicitly declared in 00-01. All work derives from that root."*

## 6. Relationship to EU Policy & Funding

The Programme Aggregator is **enabled by** EU policy intent (00-02):

```
EU Policy & Funding (00-02)
    ↓ provides mandate
Programme Authority (00-01) ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓ establishes structure
Technical Work (everywhere else)
```

## 7. Key Principle

> **Programmes need roots. This is the root.**

---

## 8. Next Steps

1. Read [00_NAVIGATION.md](./00_NAVIGATION.md) for repository map
2. Review [01_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./01_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) for information flows
3. Understand [02_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md](./02_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md) for decision rights
4. Check [03_REGISTRIES.md](./03_REGISTRIES.md) for where truth is recorded
