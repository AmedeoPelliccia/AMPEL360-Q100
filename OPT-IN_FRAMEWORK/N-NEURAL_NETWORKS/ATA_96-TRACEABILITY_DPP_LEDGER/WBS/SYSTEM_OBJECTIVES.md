## Measurable Goals

| Objective | Metric | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| OBJ-001 | Component Traceability Coverage | 100% | Every component must be tracked throughout lifecycle |
| OBJ-002 | Data Immutability | 100% | No unauthorized modifications to historical records |
| OBJ-003 | System Availability | 99.9% uptime | Critical business operations depend on ledger access |
| OBJ-004 | Transaction Latency | <1 second | Real-time updates for operational efficiency |
| OBJ-005 | Data Integrity Verification | 100% cryptographic validation | Ensure trustworthiness of all records |
| OBJ-006 | Material Provenance | 100% source tracking | Required for circularity and sustainability compliance |
| OBJ-007 | Regulatory Compliance | 100% audit trail completeness | Meet all EASA/FAA traceability requirements |
| OBJ-008 | Token Tracking Accuracy | 100% TT distribution tracking | Ensure transparent incentive distribution |
| OBJ-009 | API Response Time | <500ms (95th percentile) | Support efficient integration with external systems |
| OBJ-010 | Blockchain Synchronization | <5 minutes | Timely anchoring of records to distributed ledger |
