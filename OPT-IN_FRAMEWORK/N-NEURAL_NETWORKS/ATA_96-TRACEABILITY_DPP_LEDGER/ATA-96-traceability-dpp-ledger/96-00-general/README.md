# ATA 96-00 — Traceability/DPP Ledger (General)

**ATA Chapter 96 | Sub-Subject: 96-00-general**

---

## Overview

This section covers the general aspects of traceability and Digital Product Passport (DPP) ledger systems for the AMPEL360 Q100 aircraft. It establishes the framework for lifecycle traceability, configuration management, and digital twin synchronization.

---

## Scope

| Area | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| Digital Product Passport | DPP implementation, data schemas, lifecycle tracking |
| Traceability | Component traceability, serialization, genealogy |
| Ledger Technology | Distributed ledger, immutability, audit trails |
| Configuration Sync | As-designed vs. as-built vs. as-maintained reconciliation |
| Circularity | End-of-life tracking, recycling, material passport |

---

## Key Topics

- **Digital Product Passport (DPP)** — Standardized digital identity for aircraft components
- **Lifecycle Traceability** — From raw materials to end-of-life
- **Configuration Management** — Real-time configuration status and change tracking
- **Audit Trails** — Immutable records for regulatory compliance
- **Circularity Integration** — Support for LC14 retirement and recycling workflows
