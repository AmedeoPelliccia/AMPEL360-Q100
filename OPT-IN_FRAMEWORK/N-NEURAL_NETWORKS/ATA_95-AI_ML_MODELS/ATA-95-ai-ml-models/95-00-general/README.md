# ATA 95-00 — AI/ML Models (General)

**ATA Chapter 95 | Sub-Subject: 95-00-general**

---

## Overview

This section covers the general aspects of AI/ML models for the AMPEL360 Q100 aircraft. It establishes the framework for machine learning models used in predictive maintenance, performance optimization, flight operations, and decision support systems.

## Scope

| Area | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| Model Governance | Lifecycle management, versioning, deployment |
| Model Types | Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, optimization |
| Data Pipelines | Feature engineering, data quality, training workflows |
| Validation | Model validation, testing, and certification considerations |
| Integration | Interface with aircraft systems and ground infrastructure |
