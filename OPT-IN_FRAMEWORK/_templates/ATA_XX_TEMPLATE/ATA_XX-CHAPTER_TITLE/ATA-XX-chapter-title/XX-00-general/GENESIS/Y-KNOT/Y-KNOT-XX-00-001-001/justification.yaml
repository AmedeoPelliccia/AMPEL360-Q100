decision_summary: >
  Clearly state the decision that is being justified. Be specific about what 
  was decided and why this justification is needed.
  
  Example: "Selected [Option X] as the baseline approach for [system/component] 
  integration based on evaluation of technical feasibility, regulatory 
  compliance, cost, and schedule factors."
