O-KNOT-ATA28-10-001,Cryogenic Tank Gravimetric Efficiency,"Aviation LH₂ tanks require ≥6% gravimetric efficiency (fuel/total tank mass) to achieve competitive range, but current aerospace-qualified designs achieve only 3-5%","HIGH: Range shortfall if not achieved; aircraft weight penalty reduces payload","NASA X-57, Airbus ZEROe, Toyota Mirai","OPEN","2026-01-27","STK_SE"
O-KNOT-ATA28-10-002,BWB Conformal Tank Integration,"Integrating LH₂ tanks into BWB structure presents novel structural and thermal challenges with no heritage for commercial aviation","HIGH: Structural integrity; thermal management in distributed architecture","None (novel application)","OPEN","2026-01-27","STK_DE"
O-KNOT-ATA28-10-003,Tank Cycling Durability,"LH₂ tanks must survive 30,000+ thermal cycles (ambient to 20K) without degradation; limited test data for composite tanks at this scale","MEDIUM: Tank replacement interval; maintenance costs; safety margins","Space applications (limited cycles); automotive (fewer cycles)","OPEN","2026-01-27","STK_TE"
O-KNOT-ATA28-10-004,Boil-off Management Strategy,"Ground operations require minimal boil-off (<0.5%/day) to avoid fuel loss and safety concerns; active vs passive strategies unresolved","MEDIUM: Operational costs; ground handling complexity; fuel efficiency","Space: active cooling; Automotive: passive (short duration)","OPEN","2026-01-27","STK_SE"
O-KNOT-ATA28-10-005,MLI Performance in Flight,"Multi-Layer Insulation performance under flight vibration and pressure differential conditions is not well characterized","MEDIUM: Thermal performance degradation; boil-off increase over time","Space: vacuum environment; limited aircraft data","OPEN","2026-01-27","STK_AN"
O-KNOT-ATA28-10-006,Hydrogen Embrittlement Risk,"Long-term hydrogen exposure effects on tank materials and fittings need characterization for aircraft duty cycles","HIGH: Safety-critical; structural integrity over service life","Industrial H₂ systems; space systems","OPEN","2026-01-27","STK_SF"
