### Safety Precautions

⚠️ **WARNING**

Liquid hydrogen is an extremely cold cryogenic fluid (20 K / -253°C). Contact with skin or eyes will cause severe cold burns. Always wear appropriate PPE.

⚠️ **WARNING**

Hydrogen is flammable when mixed with air (4-75% concentration). Ensure adequate ventilation. No ignition sources within 15m radius.

⚠️ **WARNING**

Hydrogen flame is nearly invisible in daylight. Use thermal imaging or H₂ detectors to verify no fire condition.

⚠️ **CAUTION**

Rapid pressure changes can damage tank insulation. Follow prescribed fill rates.

### Procedure: LH₂ Tank Refueling

#### Pre-Refueling Checks

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Verify aircraft is properly grounded | Ground resistance <10 Ω |
| 2 | Verify H₂ detection system operational | All sensors GREEN |
| 3 | Verify fire suppression system armed | Status ARMED |
| 4 | Clear exclusion zone (15m radius) | No unauthorized personnel |
| 5 | Verify tank pressure | 2.0-3.0 bar |
| 6 | Verify tank temperature | 20-30 K |

#### Refueling Sequence

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Connect ground bonding cable | GSE to aircraft ground point |
| 2 | Remove fill port protective cap | Store in clean bag |
| 3 | Inspect fill port O-rings | Replace if damaged |
| 4 | Connect refueling adapter | Torque to 25 ±2 Nm |
| 5 | Connect cryogenic hose to adapter | Verify full engagement |
| 6 | Open GSE isolation valve | Slowly, ¼ turn/second |
| 7 | Begin chilldown sequence | Flow rate 0.1 kg/s max |
| 8 | Monitor tank temperature | Target: <25 K stable |
| 9 | Increase to full flow rate | Max 2.0 kg/s |
| 10 | Monitor tank level | Via ECAM display |
| 11 | At 98% level, reduce flow | 0.5 kg/s |
| 12 | At 100% level, stop flow | Close GSE valve |
| 13 | Allow pressure equalization | 2 minutes minimum |
| 14 | Disconnect cryogenic hose | — |
| 15 | Disconnect refueling adapter | — |
| 16 | Install fill port cap | Torque to 15 ±1 Nm |
| 17 | Disconnect ground bonding | — |
| 18 | Verify final tank state | Pressure 3.0-4.0 bar |
| 19 | Clear refueling area | Update flight deck |

#### Post-Refueling Verification

| Check | Requirement | Action if Failed |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Tank pressure | 3.0-4.0 bar | Troubleshoot per FI procedure |
| Tank temperature | 22-28 K (nominal post-refuel stabilized range; see Note 1) | Allow thermal stabilization |
| H₂ leak check | No detection | Refer to fault isolation |
| Quantity indication | Within ±2% of GSE meter | Calibrate sensors |

> **Note 1:** The LH₂ tank operating temperature range is 20-70 K as defined in DMC-001A-A Technical Specifications. Refueling operations target **<25 K stable** at the end of the fill sequence. The **22-28 K** band given here represents the expected **post-refueling stabilized tank temperature** used for verification within that broader operating envelope.
