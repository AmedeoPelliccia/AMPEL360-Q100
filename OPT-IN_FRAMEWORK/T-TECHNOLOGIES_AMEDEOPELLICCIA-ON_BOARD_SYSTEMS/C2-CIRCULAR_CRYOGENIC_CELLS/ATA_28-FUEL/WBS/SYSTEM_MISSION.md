# ATA-28 System Mission

**ATA Chapter:** 28 — Fuel Systems  
**Aircraft:** AMPEL360 Q100 (100-PAX BWB Zero-Emission)

---

## Mission Statement

**The ATA-28 Fuel Systems mission is to enable safe, reliable, and efficient storage, distribution, and delivery of Liquid Hydrogen (LH₂) fuel to power the AMPEL360 Q100's hydrogen fuel cell propulsion system, achieving zero in-flight CO₂ emissions while meeting all certification and operational requirements for commercial aviation.**

## Strategic Purpose

### Why This System Exists

1. **Enable Zero-Emission Flight**: Provide the primary energy carrier (LH₂) for hydrogen fuel cell propulsion, eliminating in-flight CO₂ emissions.

2. **Ensure Flight Safety**: Implement inherently safe LH₂ handling through cryogenic engineering best practices, redundant safety systems, and fail-safe design.

3. **Maximize Range Efficiency**: Optimize gravimetric and volumetric efficiency of LH₂ storage to achieve competitive range performance for regional operations.

4. **Support Operational Excellence**: Enable practical turnaround times, ground handling compatibility, and airline operational integration.

5. **Advance Aviation Sustainability**: Demonstrate the viability of hydrogen-electric propulsion for commercial passenger aircraft.
