decision_framing: |
  This Y-KNOT justifies the need to resolve the ATA 28-10
  Fuel Storage knowledge gaps identified in O-KNOT-28-10-001
  and evaluates resolution options for novel hydrogen
  cryogenic storage systems.

rationale: |
  Novel hydrogen fuel storage architecture introduces
  significant knowledge gaps that require resolution before
  system design can proceed. Certification pathway and
  safety considerations are primary drivers.

constraints:
  - Must comply with evolving hydrogen safety regulations
  - Must support novel means of compliance
  - Must enable cryogenic system integration
  - Must address operational safety requirements
