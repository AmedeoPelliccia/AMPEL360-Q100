# Plan Outline: KNOT-28-00-001 — Fuel System Baseline

**KNOT ID:** KNOT-28-00-001  
**Title:** Fuel System Baseline  
**Status:** Planning  
**Owner:** STK_SE  
**Target Closure:** 2026-06-30

## 1. Overview

This plan outlines the high-level steps needed to frame the ATA 28 fuel system baseline and promote the result into SSOT LC01.

**Goal:** Establish the scoped baseline, traceability, and stakeholder alignment for ATA 28 fuel systems before authoritative lifecycle work begins.

## 2. Planned KNUs (Intent Level)

| LC | Focus | Target Date |
|----|-------|-------------|
| LC01 | Problem statement baseline | 2026-03-15 |
| LC02 | System requirements seed set | 2026-04-15 |
| LC04 | Design definition entry points | 2026-05-15 |

## 3. High-Level Approach

1. Review O-KNOT and Y-KNOT discovery/justification records.
2. Define scope boundaries and acceptance intent in SSOT LC01.
3. Align fuel system stakeholders on the baseline plan.
4. Capture traceability links for downstream lifecycle work.

## 4. Dependencies

### Upstream
- KNOT-00-00-001: Program terminology standardization
- KNOT-00-00-002: Document architecture conventions

### Downstream
- SSOT LC01 problem statement artifacts
- LC02 requirements and LC04 design definition work

---

## 5. Notes

This plan remains a GENESIS (uncertainty space) artifact until the SSOT LC01 problem statement is approved.
