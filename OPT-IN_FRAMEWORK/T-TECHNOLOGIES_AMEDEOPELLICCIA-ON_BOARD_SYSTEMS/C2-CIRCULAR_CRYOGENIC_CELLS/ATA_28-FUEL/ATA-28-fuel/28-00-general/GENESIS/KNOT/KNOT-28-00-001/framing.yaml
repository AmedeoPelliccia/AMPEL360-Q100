# Bounded Scope
scope_in:
  - Fuel system baseline definition for ATA 28
  - Cryogenic storage and distribution interfaces
  - Safety and certification requirements for H₂ fuel

scope_out:
  - Detailed component design (handled in SSOT LC04)
  - Manufacturing processes (handled in SSOT LC09)

# Acceptance Criteria (Intent Level)
acceptance_intent:
  - Baseline scope for ATA 28 fuel systems documented
  - Traceability established from GENESIS to SSOT LC01
  - Stakeholder alignment captured for fuel system baseline

# High-Level Dependencies
dependencies:
  upstream:
    - KNOT-00-00-001: Program terminology standardization
    - KNOT-00-00-002: Document architecture conventions
  downstream:
    - ATA 28 SSOT LC01 problem statement
    - LC02 system requirements for Fuel

# Owner and Stakeholders

# Notes
notes: |
  This KNOT frames the ATA 28 fuel system baseline and establishes
  the intent for subsequent SSOT lifecycle work in LC01-LC14.
