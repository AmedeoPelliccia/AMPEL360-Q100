# P-PROPULSION

**Propulsion Systems (ATA 60–80)**

This axis of the OPT-IN Framework covers **propulsion systems** for the AMPEL360 Q100 aircraft — propellers/propulsors, power plant, engine, fuel control, ignition, air, controls, indicating, exhaust, oil, and starting systems.

> **Governance Note:** ATA chapters 60–80 are standard ATA chapters for Propulsion. They represent *"what propels"* — propellers, engines, fuel, ignition, controls, exhaust, oil, starting.

## ATA Chapters in This Axis

| Chapter | System | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| ATA 60 | Standard Practices — Propeller/Rotor | General practices for propeller/rotor |
| ATA 61 | Propellers/Propulsors | Propeller assembly, controlling, braking, indicating |
| ATA 71 | Power Plant | Cowling, mounts, fire seals, electrical harness |
| ATA 72 | Engine | Turbine, turboprop, ducted/unducted fan engines |
| ATA 73 | Engine Fuel and Control | Engine fuel distribution and control |
| ATA 74 | Ignition | Engine ignition systems |
| ATA 75 | Air | Engine air systems, anti-icing, cooling |
| ATA 76 | Engine Controls | Power control, emergency shutdown |
| ATA 77 | Engine Indicating | Power, temperature, analyzers |
| ATA 78 | Exhaust | Nozzle, noise suppressor, thrust reverser |
| ATA 79 | Oil | Engine oil storage and indicating |
| ATA 80 | Starting | Engine cranking and starting |

## Operational Rule

> **P-PROPULSION (T-TECHNOLOGIES / propulsion)**: *"what propels"* → propellers, engines, fuel, ignition, exhaust.

If the artifact is **propulsion/engine** → place in **P-PROPULSION**.
