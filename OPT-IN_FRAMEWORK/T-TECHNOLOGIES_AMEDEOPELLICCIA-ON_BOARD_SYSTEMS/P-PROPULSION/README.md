# P-PROPULSION Subdomain

**Axis:** T-TECHNOLOGIES  
**Subdomain Code:** P  
**ATA Chapters:** 60-61, 71-80

---

## Overview

The Propulsion subdomain covers all propulsion-related systems including propellers/propulsors, power plant, engine systems, and supporting systems (fuel control, ignition, air, controls, indicating, exhaust, oil, starting).
