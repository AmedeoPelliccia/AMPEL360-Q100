# AWARDS_TT.csv — ATA 95-00 AI/ML Models General
# This ledger is populated upon KNOT closure with actual TT distributions.
# Each row represents a reward for a specific KNU contribution.
#
# Fields:
#   timestamp              - ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of award
#   knot_id                - Parent KNOT identifier
#   knu_id                 - Knowledge Unit being rewarded
#   contributor_id         - Unique contributor identifier
#   contributor_aor        - Contributor's Area of Responsibility
#   effort_predicted       - Planned effort (story points)
#   effort_actual          - Actual effort expended
#   delta_residual_primary - Direct residual reduction achieved
#   delta_residual_adjacent_sum - Spillover impact on adjacent KNOTs
#   weight                 - Calculated weight (w_i) from formula
#   tokens_tt              - TT awarded
#   tokens_deg             - Degrees awarded (TT × 360)
#   complexity_mult        - Complexity multiplier applied
#   bonus_mult             - Bonus multiplier applied (1.0 if none)
#   tx_id                  - Transaction identifier for ledger integrity
#   validated_by           - Validator identifier
#   authority_alignment    - EASA/FAA alignment status (POSITIVE/NEUTRAL/PENDING)
#
# Hash chain integrity: Each tx_id = SHA-256(previous_tx_id + row_data)
