## Overview

The I-INFRASTRUCTURES axis covers ground support equipment (GSE), facilities, and hydrogen supply chain infrastructure required to support the AMPEL360 Q100 hydrogen-electric aircraft operations.

---

## Q100-Specific Focus

### Hydrogen Ground Support
- **H₂ Fueling Equipment** — Cryogenic LH₂ dispensing systems
- **H₂ Storage Facilities** — Ground-based LH₂ storage tanks
- **H₂ Supply Chain** — Logistics from production to aircraft

### Safety Infrastructure
- **H₂ Detection Systems** — Leak detection and monitoring
- **Emergency Response** — H₂-specific firefighting equipment
- **Ventilation Systems** — H₂-rated hangars and facilities
