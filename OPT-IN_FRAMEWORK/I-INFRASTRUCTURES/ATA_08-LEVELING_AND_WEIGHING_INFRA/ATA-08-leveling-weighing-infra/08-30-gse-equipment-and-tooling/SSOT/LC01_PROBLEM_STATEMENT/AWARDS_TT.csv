# AWARDS_TT.csv — TT Distribution Ledger for LC01 GSE Equipment and Tooling
# =============================================================================
# This file is populated at KNOT closure with actual TT distributions.
# Each row represents a reward allocation to a KNU contributor.
#
# Column Definitions:
#   timestamp                   - ISO 8601 datetime of distribution
#   knot_id                     - Parent KNOT identifier
#   knu_id                      - Knowledge Unit identifier
#   owner                       - Recipient identifier (AoR or individual)
#   effort_predicted            - Predicted effort (from KNU_PLAN.csv)
#   effort_actual               - Actual effort expended
#   delta_residual_primary      - Direct residual reduction attributed to KNU
#   delta_residual_adjacent_sum - Spillover impact sum across adjacent KNOTs
#   weight                      - Calculated weight (w_i = α·Ê_i + (1-α)·Î_i)
#   tokens_tt                   - TT amount awarded
#   tokens_deg                  - Degree equivalent (TT × 360)
#   tx_id                       - Transaction ID for ledger reference
#   validated_by                - Approver identifier
#   notes                       - Additional context
#
# Formula Reference:
#   w_i = 0.30 · Ê_i + 0.70 · Î_i
#   T_i = P_k · w_i
#   I_i = ΔR_k,i + 0.50 · S_i
#
# This ledger feeds into finance/ledger.json for hash chain integrity.
