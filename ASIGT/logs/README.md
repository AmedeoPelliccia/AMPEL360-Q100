# BREX Decision Audit Logs

This directory stores audit logs generated by the BREX Decision Engine.

## Log Files

- `brex_decisions_{session_id}.jsonl` - Newline-delimited JSON decision records
- `brex_summary_{session_id}.json` - Session summary with outcome statistics

## Log Integrity

All logs use hash-chaining for tamper-evident integrity:
- Each entry includes `previous_hash` (link to previous entry)
- Each entry includes `entry_hash` (SHA-256 of content + previous_hash)
- Genesis hash is "0" * 64

## Verification

```python
from ASIGT.brex import create_engine

engine = create_engine(session_id="your-session-id")
valid, message = engine.verify_audit_log()
print(f"Integrity: {'VALID' if valid else 'INVALID'}")
```

## Retention

- Test logs (session IDs containing "TEST" or "INTEGRATION") are excluded from git
- Production logs should be retained per program data retention policy
